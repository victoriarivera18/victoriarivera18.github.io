            <h2 class="title">My Small Auto-Biography</h2>
            <p id="sum1">
                Born in Venezuela, I spent my early childhood in Anaco around my entire extended family. Around 2004-2005, my family moved away to the United States 
                for the first time. Here, I learned English and spent the next 8 years of my life. We lived in Oklahoma and later California. 2013 was an important year for me because it was the 
                year we moved away from the United States, the only home I could remember, to the Middle Eastern country, Kuwait. Culture shock was inevitable, but the Middle East was where I gained lifelong friends
                and was able to discover what the rest of the world had to offer. I loved learning about new cultures and it was here, ironically, where I grew to love and embrace my own Latin and Hispanic identity. 
                These years were the best years of my life. But, not surprisingly, we moved yet again in 2016 to Houston, Texas. I remained here
                until coming to College Station to attend Texas A&M University. Initially a Mechanical Engineering major, it was in my introductory engineering course that I discovered a passion for programming and solving logical problems. 
                After that, I didn't look back, and now I'm studying to attain my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

                    <h3>YouTube</h3>
                    <p class="desc">{Excpetion Thrown} is a Youtube channel I created in April 2020 while I finished up my classes for the semester at home. The premise 
                        of my channel is to show what coding projects and assignments actually look like through the prespective of a college student. In my videos, I detail the 
                        struggle that all programmers face when writting and debugging code. I show myself Googling and reading documentation to give viewers and realistic look 
                        at the day-to-day of solving a coding problem.

                    <h3>Options Trading</h3>
                    <p class="desc">One of my life goals is to become finacially independent at a young age. I became obsessed with this idea aroung the age of 18 and started looked for ways 
                        to grow finacially. Options trading is one of the means to this end. Using Robinhood and a relatively small amouny of capital, I trade
                        using strategies devised by Colombian economist Alejandro Cardona. Right now, I look to make a 5% gain of my total account per week. Eventually, 
                        I do hope to gain confidence and trade more frequently and effectively.

                    <h3>Keyboards</h3>
                    <p class="desc">The hobby of mechanical keyboards is something new to me. It started out by watching Youtube videos. But very quickly, I became a little obsessed with the hobby; specifically, all the different customizations that could be made to any one keyboard. 
                        My discord is full of keyboard enthusiast servers now. I am currently constructing keyboards for my cousin and myself and will the picture below once they are done!
